Material of video TT #8: How to Create a One-shot circuit in Qspice

Available at https://youtu.be/MvBJkOed7MA

This video explains how to create a one-shot circuit (monostable flip-flop) in Qspice. The video shows also how to create embedded components that can be simulated by themselves without carrying on a library file. This is very convenient to share simulation files with other people.
